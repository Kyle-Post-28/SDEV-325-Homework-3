# SDEV-325-Homework-3
In this assignment, I had to create two simple applications, one being an applicaiont in C or C++, and another being a web application utilizing HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript. Both applications were created to highlight a specific vulnerability and a possible mitigation technique. There are two versions of each application. One version demonstrates the vulnerability and the other demonstrates a mitigation techinuqe put into place. The first vulnerability is a Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input aka a Classic Buffer OverFlow and the second vulnerability is Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere. In addition to the code I have screen captured and documented everything in a MS word file. Enjoy!
